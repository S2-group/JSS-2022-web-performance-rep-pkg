Participants will be shown six videos that show a web page loading. Each pair of videos shows a different page, with a slight difference between the two videos. The participant is tasked to indicate when they believe the web page has finished loading. For each video, the participant is asked to press the spacebar to begin the video. Once they believe the shown web page has finished loading, they should press the spacebar again. For every pair of videos, there will be a demo video, so that the participant has an indication of what is coming. Since every millisecond is of the essence here, the participant is asked to keep their hands on the spacebar at all times, so that they can be ready to indicate a loaded web page quickly. Furthermore, the participant should note that the videos shown will be very short, so staying attentive is very important. In essence, the experiment should be considered a reflex game.
