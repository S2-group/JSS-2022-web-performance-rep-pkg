### Overview of the replication package
---

This replication package is structured as follows:

- Performance benchmarking tools can be found in the `metrics` and `metrics-ff` folders, for Chrome and Firefox respectively. The results can be found in `results`. The first result is the baseline situation.
- Analysis scripts and the raw data can be found in the `analyze` and `network` folders
- User study results, the app used, the experiment guide given to participants, and the analysis scripts can be found in the `userstudy` and `userstudy-tools` folders
