# 30MHz case study in web performance â€“ Replication package

This repository contains the replication package and dataset of the 30MHz case study on web performance. Using this repo, one can generate performance benchmark results for any web page, or replicate the results of the case study, as well as its statistical analysis.

This study has been designed, developed, and reported by the following investigators:

- [Jasper van Riet](https://jaspervanriet.nl) (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 30MHz)
- [Ivano Malavolta](https://www.ivanomalavolta.com) (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)
- [Flavia Paganelli](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/flaviapaganelli) (30MHz)

For any information, interested researchers can contact us by sending an email to any of the investigators listed above.
The full dataset including raw data, performance benchmarking tools, and analysis scripts produced during the study are available below.

### Overview of the replication package
---

This replication package is structured as follows:

- Performance benchmarking tools can be found in the `metrics` and `metrics-ff` folders, for Chrome and Firefox respectively. The results can be found in `results`. The first result is the baseline situation.
- Analysis scripts and the raw data can be found in the `analyze` and `network` folders
- User study results, the app used, the experiment guide given to participants, and the analysis scripts can be found in the `userstudy` and `userstudy-tools` folders
